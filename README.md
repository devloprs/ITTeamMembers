# ITTeamMembers
Development Repo for ITTeamMembers

Installation: Just upload and activate the plugin and use the shortcode ct_team anywhere you wish to display members of the IT Team.

The plugin defines one custom post type called team_members and one taxonomy called "departments". In the custom post type you have the ability to add, remove, or set a department for a team member. The departments show up for filtering in the content and members are filtered in and out of the isotope presentation depending on which filter is selected.
